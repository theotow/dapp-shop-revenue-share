# Revenue share for shops

This dapp allows to share the revenue a online shop generates with the shoppers.

Shoppers which spend a lot are rewarded more.

Shoppers earn cash back rewards on every purchase.

Shoppers can transfer their reward "cards". Since those are NFTs. (not implemented)

Usage:

1. Payments must be done with USDCx (superfluid super token)
2. To receive payments you must approve the subscription in [https://app.superfluid.finance/dashboard](https://app.superfluid.finance/dashboard) -> see Distribution section

Powered by: [https://www.superfluid.finance/home](https://www.superfluid.finance/home)

Not implemented yet:

- NFT transfer (backend)
- Show how much cashback can be received on purchase (backend + frontend)

# 💌 P.S.

🌍 You need an RPC key for testnets and production deployments, create an [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) account and replace the value of `ALCHEMY_KEY = xxx` in `packages/react-app/src/constants.js` with your new key.

📣 Make sure you update the `InfuraID` before you go to production. Huge thanks to [Infura](https://infura.io/) for our special account that fields 7m req/day!
